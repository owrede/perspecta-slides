## 🎨 Core Concepts at a Glance

### 4 Presentation Patterns

| Pattern | Duration | Structure | Slide Count | Best For |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **PITCH** | 5-20 min | Problem → Solution → Why You → CTA | 5-10 | Convincing of idea/product |
| **ACADEMIC** | 15-45 min | Question → Background → Methods → Findings → Implications | 10-20 | Presenting research |
| **STRUCTURED** | 20-45 min | Overview → Elements → Connections → Application | 12-20 | Teaching frameworks |
| **NARRATIVE** | 10-30 min | Setting → Conflict → Exploration → Resolution | 10-15 | Telling stories/journeys |

### 12 Slide Layouts

**Structural**: `title` (open), `section` (divide), `cover` (close)

**Text**: `1-column` (dense), `2-columns` (comparison), `2-columns-1+2` (intro+main), `2-columns-2+1` (list+insight), `3-columns` (three ideas)

**Image**: `caption` (image+text), `full-image` (cinematic), `half-image` (vertical split), `half-image-horizontal` (stacked)

### Layout Decision Logic

- **1-column** ← Dense explanation
- **2-columns** ← Pro/con, before/after, comparison
- **2-columns-1+2** ← Small concept + detailed explanation
- **2-columns-2+1** ← List + interpretation
- **3-columns** ← Three equally important ideas
- **caption** ← Proof point, real-world example
- **full-image** ← Mood, establishing context
- **half-image** ← Product + features, concept + visual
