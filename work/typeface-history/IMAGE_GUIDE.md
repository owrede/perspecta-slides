## Visual Consistency Checklist

As you collect images, maintain these aesthetic principles:

✓ **Color palette**: Warm for historical slides (6, 8), cool/modern for contemporary slides (9, 10)
✓ **Composition**: Mix of detail shots (metal type, tools) and full compositions (printing press, interfaces)
✓ **Quality**: Only high-resolution, professional-quality images
✓ **Diversity**: Include images showing different cultures, eras, and people (especially in "Today" and "Future" sections)

## Image Placeholders in Markdown

Once you've downloaded images, reference them in the markdown:

Change:
```markdown
![[IMAGE: printing-press | metal-type-letters | gutenberg-workshop]]
```

To:
```markdown
![Gutenberg printing press with metal type](./images/gutenberg-printing-press.jpg)
```

---

## Optional: Create a Mood Board

Create a folder `mood-board/` in this directory with alternative images or inspiration shots that didn't make the final cut. This helps future iterations and keeps design thinking visible.
