## 🎯 What This Skill Does

**Input**: Presentation briefing (topic, goal, duration, key points, style)  
**Output**: Complete Perspecta Slides Markdown file ready to present  
**Time**: ~30 minutes from briefing to ready-to-use file  
**Quality**: Professional structure, intelligent layouts, beautiful images, detailed speaker notes

---

## 🏗️ Skill Architecture

### **7-Step Workflow**
1. Analyze the briefing (identify presentation pattern)
2. Structure the presentation (calculate slide count & sequence)
3. Select layouts (use decision tree for each slide)
4. Suggest images (Unsplash search terms + aesthetic guidance)
5. Write speaker notes (timing + talking points)
6. Apply markdown formatting (emphasis, lists, quotes, code)
7. Output complete file (ready to open in Obsidian/Perspecta)

### **4 Presentation Patterns**
- **PITCH** (5-20 min) — Convince of idea/product
- **ACADEMIC** (15-45 min) — Present research findings
- **STRUCTURED** (20-45 min) — Teach framework/how-to
- **NARRATIVE** (10-30 min) — Tell a story/journey

### **12 Slide Layouts** + Decision Logic
- Structural: `title`, `section`, `cover`
- Text-based: `1-column`, `2-columns`, `2-columns-1+2`, `2-columns-2+1`, `3-columns`
- Image-based: `caption`, `full-image`, `half-image`, `half-image-horizontal`

Each with specific decision rules, use cases, and examples.

## 💡 Design Decisions Embedded

The skill encapsulates these proven principles:

1. **Presentation structure matters more than design** — Identify the pattern first
2. **Layouts carry meaning** — Not decorative; teach relationships between ideas
3. **Timing is realistic** — Not 1 slide per minute; varies by content density
4. **Images drive cohesion** — Consistent photographer/style = professionalism
5. **Speaker notes ≠ slides** — Detailed notes let presenters be natural
6. **One idea per slide** — Visual breathing room is a feature
7. **Narrative arc is essential** — Even structured presentations need a story
8. **Template ≠ formula** — Patterns are guides, not rigid rules

---

## ✅ Quality Assurance

All content verified for:
- ✅ Accuracy relative to Perspecta Slides features
- ✅ Practical applicability (tested with real example)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage (4 patterns × 12 layouts)
- ✅ Clear structure and navigation
- ✅ Actionable guidance (not just theory)
- ✅ Copy-paste ready examples
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (quick start → deep dive)
