## Presentation Patterns at a Glance

| Pattern | Duration | Slide Count | Use When | Energy |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| **PITCH** | 5-20 min | 5-10 | Convince of idea/product | High |
| **ACADEMIC** | 15-45 min | 10-20 | Present research findings | Detailed |
| **STRUCTURED** | 20-45 min | 12-20 | Teach framework/how-to | Organized |
| **NARRATIVE** | 10-30 min | 10-15 | Tell a journey/story | Emotional |

## Layout Quick Reference

**Text**: `1-column` → dense explanations  
**Comparison**: `2-columns` → pro/con, then/now  
**Intro + Details**: `2-columns-1+2` → concept + explanation  
**List + Commentary**: `2-columns-2+1` → content + insight  
**Three Ideas**: `3-columns` → natural grouping  
**Image + Text**: `caption`, `full-image`, `half-image`, `half-image-horizontal`  
**Structure**: `title`, `section`, `cover` → openings, dividers, closings

## Image Aesthetic Strategy

- **PITCH**: Bright, energetic, diverse people
- **ACADEMIC**: Professional, scientific, grounded
- **STRUCTURED**: Clear, organized, architectural
- **NARRATIVE**: Emotional, cinematic, thematic

Search Unsplash with 3-5 keywords per slide. Keep photographer consistent across multiple images.

## Key Principles

1. **Pattern first** - Identify the presentation style before structuring
2. **One layout per slide** - Each slide has a clear purpose
3. **Breathing room** - Whitespace is a feature, not wasted space
4. **Speaker-centric notes** - Detailed notes let presenter be natural
5. **Visual consistency** - Unified aesthetic > random images
6. **Build pacing** - Match slide count to presentation duration
7. **Narrative arc** - Presentations are stories, not just information

## Example Use Case

**Briefing**: "I need to pitch an AI tool for medical diagnosis. 12 minutes, investor audience. We want to show the problem (missed diagnoses), our solution (ML model), and real results."

**Skill will**:
1. Recognize PITCH pattern → high-energy structure
2. Plan ~6-8 slides → ~1.5-2 min per slide
3. Choose layouts: title → problem (caption) → solution (2-columns-1+2) → results (caption) → ask (cover)
4. Suggest images: "medical setting", "diverse medical team", "technology", "accuracy metrics"
5. Write timing: "(1 min)" under each slide with key talking points
6. Output: Complete Markdown with frontmatter, ready to open in Obsidian
